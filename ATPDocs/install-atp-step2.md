In this quickstart, you'll connect Azure ATP to Active Directory (AD) to retrieve data about users and computers. If you're connecting multiple forests, see the [Multi-forest support](atp-multi-forest.md) article.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure ATP instance](install-atp-step1.md).
- Review the [Azure ATP prerequisites](atp-prerequisites.md) article.
- An **on-premises** AD user account and password with read access to all objects in the monitored domains.

## Provide a username and password to connect to your Active Directory Forest

The first time you open the Azure ATP portal, the following screen appears:

1. Enter the following information and click **Save**:

    |Field|Comments|
    |---------|------------|
    |**Username** (required)|Enter the read-only Active Directory user name. For example: **ATPuser**.  You must use an **on-premises** AD user account. **Don't** use the UPN format for your username.|
    |**Password** (required)|Enter the password for the read-only user. For example: **Pencil1**.|
    |**Domain** (required)|Enter the domain for the read-only user. For example: **contoso.com**. It's important that you enter the complete FQDN of the domain where the user is located. For example, if the user’s account is in domain corp.contoso.com, you need to enter `corp.contoso.com` not contoso.com|

2. In the Azure ATP portal, click **Download sensor setup and install the first sensor** to continue.
