# Azure ATP Prerequisites
This article describes the requirements for a successful deployment of Azure ATP in your environment.

>[!NOTE]
> For information on how to plan resources and capacity, see [Azure ATP capacity planning](atp-capacity-planning.md).


Azure ATP is composed of the Azure ATP cloud service, which consists of the management portal, workspace portal, the Azure ATP sensor and/or the Azure ATP standalone sensor. For more information about each of the Azure ATP components, see [Azure ATP architecture](atp-architecture.md).

Each Azure ATP instance supports a multiple Active Directory forest boundary and Forest Functional Level (FFL) of Windows 2003 and above.

## Before you start
This section lists information you should gather and accounts and network entities you should have before starting Azure ATP installation.


-   An **on-premises** AD user account and password with read access to all objects in the monitored domains.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have set custom ACLs on various Organizational Units (OU) in your domain, make sure that the selected user has read permissions to those OUs.

-   If you run Wireshark on Azure ATP standalone sensor, you will need to restart the Azure Advanced Threat Protection sensor service after you have stopped the Wireshark capture. If not, the sensor stops capturing traffic.

- If you attempt to install the ATP sensor on a machine configured with a NIC Teaming adapter, you receive an installation error. If you want to install the ATP sensor on a machine configured with NIC teaming, see [Azure ATP sensor NIC teaming issue](troubleshooting-atp-known-issues.md#nic-teaming).

-    Recommended: User should have read-only permissions on the Deleted Objects container. This allows Azure ATP to detect bulk deletion of objects in the domain. For information about configuring read-only permissions on the Deleted Objects container, see the **Changing permissions on a deleted object container** section in the [View or Set Permissions on a Directory Object](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc816824%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) article.

-   Optional: A user account of a user who has no network activities. This account is configured as the Azure ATP Honeytoken user. For more information, see [Configure exclusions and Honeytoken user](install-atp-step7.md).

-   Optional: When deploying the standalone sensor, it is necessary to forward Windows events 4776, 4732, 4733, 4728, 4729, 4756, 4757, and 7045 to ATP to further enhance Azure ATP Pass-the-Hash, Brute Force, Modification to sensitive groups, Honey Tokens detections, and malicious service creation. Azure ATP sensor receives these events automatically. In Azure ATP standalone sensor, these events can be received from your SIEM or by setting Windows Event Forwarding from your domain controller. Events collected provide Azure ATP with additional information that is not available via the domain controller network traffic.


## Azure ATP workspace management portal and workspace portal requirements
Access to the Azure ATP workspace portal and the Azure ATP workspace management portal is via a browser, supporting the following browsers and settings:
-	Microsoft Edge
-	Internet Explorer version 10 and above
-	Google Chrome 4.0 and above
-	Minimum screen width resolution of 1700 pixels
-	Firewall/proxy open - To communicate with the Azure ATP cloud service *.atp.azure.com port 443 must be open in your firewall/proxy. 

## Azure ATP standalone sensor requirements
This section lists the requirements for the Azure ATP standalone sensor.
### General
The Azure ATP standalone sensor supports installation on a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016 (Include server core).
The Azure ATP standalone sensor can be installed on a server that is a member of a domain or workgroup.
The Azure ATP standalone sensor can be used to monitor Domain Controllers with Domain Functional Level of Windows 2003 and above.

For your standalone sensor to communicate with the cloud service, port 443 in your firewalls and proxies to *.atp.azure.com must be open.


For information on using virtual machines with the Azure ATP standalone sensor, see [Configure port mirroring](configure-port-mirroring.md).

> [!NOTE]
> A minimum of 5 GB of disk space is required and 10 GB is recommended. This includes space needed for the Azure ATP binaries, Azure ATP logs, and performance logs.

### Server specifications
For optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the Azure ATP standalone sensor to **High Performance**.<br>
An Azure ATP standalone sensor can support monitoring multiple domain controllers, depending on the amount of network traffic to and from the domain controllers.

>[!NOTE] 
> When running as a virtual machine, dynamic memory or any other memory ballooning feature is not supported.

For more information about the Azure ATP standalone sensor hardware requirements, see [Azure ATP capacity planning](atp-capacity-planning.md).

### Time synchronization

The servers and domain controllers onto which the sensor is installed must have time synchronized to within five minutes of each other.


### Network adapters
The Azure ATP standalone sensor requires at least one Management adapter and at least one Capture adapter:

-   **Management adapter** - used for communications on your corporate network. The sensor will use this adapter to query the DC itâ€™s protecting and performing resolution to machine accounts. <br>This adapter should be configured with the following settings:

    -   Static IP address including default gateway

    -   Preferred and alternate DNS servers

    -   The **DNS suffix for this connection** should be the DNS name of the domain for each domain being monitored.

        ![Configure DNS suffix in advanced TCP/IP settings](media/ATP-DNS-Suffix.png)

        > [!NOTE]
        > If the Azure ATP standalone sensor is a member of the domain, this may be configured automatically.

-   **Capture adapter** - used to capture traffic to and from the domain controllers.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > -   Configure port mirroring for the capture adapter as the destination of the domain controller network traffic. For more information, see [Configure port mirroring](configure-port-mirroring.md). Typically, you need to work with the networking or virtualization team to configure port mirroring.
    > -   Configure a static non-routable IP address for your environment with no default sensor and no DNS server addresses. For example, 1.1.1.1/32. This ensures that the capture network adapter can capture the maximum amount of traffic and that the management network adapter is used to send and receive the required network traffic.

### Ports
The following table lists the minimum ports that the Azure ATP standalone sensor requires configured on the management adapter:

|Protocol|Transport|Port|To/From|Direction|
|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
|**Internet ports**|||||
|SSL (*.atp.azure.com)|TCP|443|Azure ATP cloud service|Outbound|

## Azure ATP sensor requirements
This section lists the requirements for the Azure ATP sensor.
### General
The Azure ATP sensor supports installation on a domain controller running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (not including Server Core), Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016 (including Core but not Nano).

The domain controller can be a read-only domain controller (RODC).

For your domain controllers to communicate with the cloud service, you must open port 443 in your firewalls and proxies to *.atp.azure.com.

During installation, the .Net Framework 4.7 is installed and might require a reboot of the domain controller, if a restart is already pending.


> [!NOTE]
> A minimum of 5 GB of disk space is required and 10 GB is recommended. This includes space needed for the Azure ATP binaries, Azure ATP logs, and performance logs.

### Server specifications

The Azure ATP sensor requires a minimum of two cores and 6 GB of RAM installed on the domain controller.
For optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the Azure ATP sensor to **High Performance**.
The Azure ATP sensor can be deployed on domain controllers of various loads and sizes, depending on the amount of network traffic to and from the domain controllers and the amount of resources installed on that domain controller.

>[!NOTE] 
> When running as a virtual machine, dynamic memory or any other memory ballooning feature is not supported.

For more information about the Azure ATP sensor hardware requirements, see [Azure ATP capacity planning](atp-capacity-planning.md).

### Time synchronization

The servers and domain controllers onto which the sensor is installed must have time synchronized to within five minutes of each other.

### Network adapters
