# Azure ATP Security Alerts

## Security alert name mapping and unique external IDs

In version 2.56, all existing Azure ATP security alerts were renamed with easier to understand names. Mapping between old and new names, and their corresponding unique externalIds are as listed in the following table. Microsoft recommends use of alert external IDs in place of alert names for scripts or automation as only security alert external IDs are permanent and not subject to change.

Azure ATP security alerts are divided into the following categories or phases, like the phases seen in a typical cyber-attack kill chain. Learn more about each phase, the alerts designed to detect each attack, and how to use the alerts to help protect your network using the following links:

*Phases:*
    [1. Reconnaissance alerts](atp-reconnaissance-alerts.md)
   <br>[2. Compromised credential alerts](atp-compromised-credentials-alerts.md)
   <br>[3. Lateral movement alerts](atp-lateral-movement-alerts.md)
   <br>[4. Domain dominance alerts](atp-domain-dominance-alerts.md)
   <br>[5. Exfiltration alerts](atp-exfiltration-alerts.md)
