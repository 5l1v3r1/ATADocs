# What's new in Azure ATP 



## Azure ATP release 2.28

Released April 15, 2018
 
-	Users who are members of the role groups Azure ATP Users and Azure ATP Viewers now have permissions to see monitoring alerts.
- This version includes fixes and improvements for multiple issues. 


## Azure ATP release 2.27

Released April 8, 2018

- You now have the ability to provide user feedback from the top navigation bar. Clicking the smiley face in the menu bar enables you to send an email to the Azure Advanced Threat Protection team with your feedback.

- This version includes fixes and improvements for multiple issues. 
 

## Azure ATP release 2.26

Released March 25, 2018

- When Azure ATP alerts you of a suspicious activity that you identify as a benign positive (a legitimate action that is not a suspicious activity) you have the option to exclude computers and IP addresses for more detections, including: Encryption downgrade, LDAP brute force, Forged PAC, Brute force and Pass-the-hash.
-	The Azure ATP sensor performance was improved.
-	A new region was added for Workspace deployment, you can now deploy a workspace in Asia. 


## Azure ATP release 2.25

Released March 18, 2018

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is now supported in Azure ATP. Tenants using MFA can now enter the Azure ATP portal.
- Azure ATP now has a [**System status**](https://health.atp.azure.com/) page to provide you with information as to whether the Workspace management portal is up and active, if there are issues with detections and if the Sensor is able to send traffic to the cloud. You can access the **System status** from the Azure ATP menu bar.


## Azure ATP release 2.24

Released March 11, 2018

**New & updated detections**
  -	Suspicious service creation â€“ Attackers attempt to run suspicious services on your network. Azure ATP now raises an alert when it identifies that someone on a specific computer is running a new service that seems suspicious. This detection is based on events (not network traffic) and is detected on any domain controller in your network that is forwarding event 7045 to Azure ATP. For more information see the [Suspicious activity guide](suspicious-activity-guide.md).

**Improved investigation**
  -	Azure ATP includes an enriched [entity profile](entity-profiles.md). The entity profile provides you with a platform that is designed for deep-dive investigation of user activities This includes the resources they accessed, computers they logged onto, and many more. The entity profile also provides directory data and enables you to identify potential lateral movement paths to or from the entity, enabling you to learn more about the potential breaches in your organization.

  -	ATP enables you to manually tag entities as *sensitive* to enhance detections and monitoring. This tagging impacts many Azure ATP detections, such as sensitive group modification detection and [lateral movement path](use-case-lateral-movement-path.md), which rely on entities that are considered sensitive.

**New reports to help you investigate**
  -	The [Passwords exposed in clear text report](reports.md) enables you to detect when services send account credentials are sent in plain text. This allows you to investigate services and improve your network security level. This report replaces the cleartext suspicious activity alerts.
  -	The [Lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts report](reports.md) lists the sensitive accounts that are exposed via lateral movement paths. This enables you to mitigate these paths and harden your network to minimize the attack surface risk. This enables you to prevent lateral movement so that attackers can't move across your network between users and computers until they hit the virtual security jackpot: your sensitive admin account credentials.

- You can now easily access the documentation from a link provide within a suspicious activity alert in order to view [investigation steps that you can take](suspicious-activity-guide.md). 

**Performance improvements**
 -	The Azure ATP sensor infrastructure was improved for performance: the aggregated view of traffic enables optimization of CPU and packet pipeline, and reuses sockets to the domain controllers to minimize SSL sessions to the DC.
