# What's new in Azure ATP 

## Azure ATP release 2.24

Released March 11, 2018

**New & updated detections**
  -	Suspicious service creation â€“ Attackers attempt to run suspicious services on your network. Azure ATP now raises an alert when it identifies that someone on a specific computer is running a new service that seems suspicious. This detection is based on events (not network traffic) and is detected on any domain controller in your network that is forwarding event 7045 to Azure ATP. For more information see the [Suspicious activity guide](suspicious-activity-guide.md).
**Improved investigation**
  -	Azure ATP includes an enriched [entity profile](entity-profiles.md). The entity profile provides you with a platform that is designed for deep-dive investigation of user activities This includes the resources they accessed, computers they logged onto, and many more. The entity profile also provides directory data and enables you to identify potential lateral movement paths to or from the entity, enabling you to learn more about the potential breaches in your organization.

  -	ATP enables you to manually tag entities as *sensitive* to enhance detections and monitoring. This tagging impacts many Azure ATP detections, such as sensitive group modification detection and [lateral movement path](use-case-lateral-movement-path.md), which rely on entities that are considered sensitive.

**New reports to help you investigate**
  -	The [Passwords exposed in clear text report](reports.md) enables you to detect when services send account credentials are sent in plain text. This allows you to investigate services and improve your network security level. This report replaces the cleartext suspicious activity alerts.
  -	The [Lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts report](reports.md) lists the sensitive accounts that are exposed via lateral movement paths. This enables you to mitigate these paths and harden your network to minimize the attack surface risk. This enables you to prevent lateral movement so that attackers can't move across your network between users and computers until they hit the virtual security jackpot: your sensitive admin account credentials.

- You can now easily access the documentation from a link provide within a suspicious activity alert in order to view [investigation steps that you can take](suspicious-activity-guide.md). 

**Performance improvements**
 -	The Azure ATP sensor infrastructure was improved for performance: the aggregated view of traffic enables optimization of CPU and packet pipeline, and reuses sockets to the domain controllers to minimize SSL sessions to the DC.
