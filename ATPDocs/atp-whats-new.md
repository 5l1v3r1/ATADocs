## Azure ATP release 2.67
Released February 24, 2019

- **New security alert: Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) – (preview)**<br>

    Azure ATP’s [Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) - preview](atp-reconnaissance-alerts.md#security-principal-reconnaissance-ldap-external-id-2038---preview) security alert is now in public preview. <br> In this detection, an Azure ATP security alert is triggered when security principal reconnaissance is used by attackers to gain critical information about the domain environment. This information helps attackers map the domain structure, as well as identify privileged accounts for use in later steps in their attack kill chain. 

    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is one the most popular methods used for both legitimate and malicious purposes to query Active Directory. LDAP focused security principal reconnaissance is commonly used as the first phase of a Kerberoasting attack. Kerberoasting attacks are used to get a target list of Security Principal Names (SPNs), which attackers then attempt to get Ticket Granting Server (TGS) tickets for.

- **Feature enhancement: Account enumeration reconnaissance (NTLM) alert** <br> 
    Improved **Account enumeration reconnaissance (NTLM)** alert using additional analysis, and improved detection logic to reduce **B-TP** and **FP** alert results.

## Azure ATP release 2.53
Released November 4, 2018

- **Security Alert enhancement: Suspicious Authentication Failure**<br>
Azure ATP’s [Suspicious Authentication Failure security alert](suspicious-activity-guide.md) now includes monitoring for detection of password spray brute force attacks.
In a typical **password spray** attack, after successfully enumerating a list of valid users from the domain controller, attackers try ONE carefully crafted password against ALL of the known user accounts (one password to many accounts). When the initial password spray is not successful, they'll try again, utilizing a different carefully crafted password, normally after waiting 30 minutes between attempts. The wait time allows attackers to avoid triggering most time-based account lockout thresholds. Password spray has quickly become a favorite technique of both attackers and pen testers. Password spray attacks have proven to be effective at gaining an initial foothold in an organization, and for making subsequent lateral moves, trying to escalate privileges. 

- **Feature enhancement: Send a test Syslog message**<br>	New ability to send a test Syslog message during the SIEM setup process. See [Integrate with Syslog](setting-syslog.md), to learn more. 

- This version also includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## Azure ATP release 2.35

Released June 10, 2018
 
- **New preview detections**<br></br>From now on, Azure ATP will take advantage of the fact that it's a cloud service -- where new features can be delivered in fast cycles -- and provide you with new detections as quickly as possible. These new detections will be tagged as "preview" when they are first released. Usually a new detection will move from preview to general availability within a few weeks. By default you will see preview detections. For information about opting out, see [preview detections](working-with-suspicious-activities.md#preview-detections).
 
- **Suspicious VPN detection**<br></br>This release introduces a preview version of the Suspicious VPN detection. Azure ATP learns user VPN behavior, including the machines the users signed in to and the locations the users connect from, and alerts you when there is a deviation from the expected behavior. For more information, see [Suspicious VPN detection](suspicious-activity-guide.md).

- **Delayed update**<br></br>You now have the option to set Azure ATP sensors to update at a later time, each time Azure ATP updates. You can now set each Azure ATP sensor to **Delayed update** so that it will update 24 hours after the Azure ATP cloud service updates. This feature enables you to test the update on specific test sensors and only update your production sensors later on. If you discover an issue during the first update cycle, open a support ticket. For more information see [Update Azure ATP sensors](sensor-update.md).

- **Updated unusual protocol implementation detection**<br></br>The unusual protocol implementation detection now provides more information. You can now see which potential attack tool Azure ATP suspects is at work on your network. For more information, see the [Suspicious activity guide](suspicious-activity-guide.md).
 
- **Outdated sensor alert**<br></br>Azure ATP includes a new monitoring alert to let you know if a sensor is more than three versions outdated. If you see this alert, you should update the sensor, or investigate why the sensor isn't updating automatically. If the alert recurs, uninstall and reinstall the sensor.

## Azure ATP release 2.26

Released March 25, 2018

- When Azure ATP alerts you of a suspicious activity that you identify as a benign positive (a legitimate action that is not a suspicious activity) you have the option to exclude computers and IP addresses for more detections, including: Encryption downgrade, LDAP brute force, Forged PAC, Brute force and Pass-the-hash.
-	The Azure ATP sensor performance was improved.
-	A new region was added for Workspace deployment, you can now deploy a workspace in Asia. 


## Azure ATP release 2.25

Released March 18, 2018

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is now supported in Azure ATP. Tenants using MFA can now enter the Azure ATP portal.
- Azure ATP now has a [**System status**](https://health.atp.azure.com/) page to provide you with information as to whether the Workspace management portal is up and active, if there are issues with detections and if the Sensor is able to send traffic to the cloud. You can access the **System status** from the Azure ATP menu bar.


## Azure ATP release 2.24

Released March 11, 2018

**New & updated detections**
  -	Suspicious service creation – Attackers attempt to run suspicious services on your network. Azure ATP now raises an alert when it identifies that someone on a specific computer is running a new service that seems suspicious. This detection is based on events (not network traffic) and is detected on any domain controller in your network that is forwarding event 7045 to Azure ATP. For more information see the [Suspicious activity guide](suspicious-activity-guide.md).

**Improved investigation**
  -	Azure ATP includes an enriched [entity profile](entity-profiles.md). The entity profile provides you with a platform that is designed for deep-dive investigation of user activities This includes the resources they accessed, computers they logged onto, and many more. The entity profile also provides directory data and enables you to identify potential lateral movement paths to or from the entity, enabling you to learn more about the potential breaches in your organization.

  -	ATP enables you to manually tag entities as *sensitive* to enhance detections and monitoring. This tagging impacts many Azure ATP detections, such as sensitive group modification detection and [lateral movement path](use-case-lateral-movement-path.md), which rely on entities that are considered sensitive.

**New reports to help you investigate**
  -	The [Passwords exposed in clear text report](reports.md) enables you to detect when services send account credentials are sent in plain text. This allows you to investigate services and improve your network security level. This report replaces the cleartext suspicious activity alerts.
  -	The [Lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts report](reports.md) lists the sensitive accounts that are exposed via lateral movement paths. This enables you to mitigate these paths and harden your network to minimize the attack surface risk. This enables you to prevent lateral movement so that attackers can't move across your network between users and computers until they hit the virtual security jackpot: your sensitive admin account credentials.

- You can now easily access the documentation from a link provide within a suspicious activity alert in order to view [investigation steps that you can take](suspicious-activity-guide.md). 

**Performance improvements**
 -	The Azure ATP sensor infrastructure was improved for performance: the aggregated view of traffic enables optimization of CPU and packet pipeline, and reuses sockets to the domain controllers to minimize SSL sessions to the DC.
