|Issue|Description|Resolution|
|-------------|----------|---------|
|No traffic received from domain controller, but monitoring alerts are observed|	No traffic was received from a domain controller using port mirroring through an ATP Gateway|On the ATP Gateway capture NIC, disable these features in **Advanced Settings**:<br></br>Receive Segment Coalescing (IPv4)<br></br>Receive Segment Coalescing (IPv6)|
|This monitoring alert is displayed: **Some network traffic is not being analyzed**|If you have an ATP Gateway or Lightweight Gateway on VMware virtual machines, you might receive this monitoring alert.
