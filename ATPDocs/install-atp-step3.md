# Quickstart: Download the Azure ATP sensor setup package

In this quickstart, you'll download the Azure ATP sensor setup package from the portal.

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure ATP instance](install-atp-step1.md) that's [connected to Active Directory](install-atp-step2.md).

## Download the setup package

After configuring the domain connectivity settings, you can download the Azure ATP sensor setup package. The Azure ATP sensor setup package can be installed on a dedicated server or on a domain controller. When installing directly on a domain controller, it's installed as an Azure ATP sensor, when installing on a dedicated server and using port mirroring, it's installed as Azure ATP standalone sensor. For more information on the Azure ATP sensor, see [Azure ATP Architecture](atp-architecture.md). 

Click **Download** in the list of steps at the top of the page to go to the **Sensor** page.

 To reach the sensor configuration screen later, click the **settings icon** (upper right corner), select **Configuration**, then, under **System**, click **sensor**.  

1. Click **sensor**.
2. Save the package locally.
3. Copy the **Access** **key**. The access key is required for the Azure ATP sensor to connect to your Azure ATP instance. The access key is a one-time-password for sensor deployment, after which all communication is performed using certificates for authentication and TLS encryption. Use the **Regenerate** button if you ever need to regenerate the new access key, you can, and it won't affect any previously deployed sensors, because it's only used for initial registration of the sensor.
4. Copy the package to the dedicated server or domain controller onto which you're installing the Azure ATP sensor. Alternatively, you can open the Azure ATP portal from the dedicated server or domain controller and skip this step.

The zip file includes the following files:

- Azure ATP sensor installer

- Configuration setting file with the required information to connect to the Azure ATP cloud service
