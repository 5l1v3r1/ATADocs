# Advanced Threat Analytics Documentation

Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is an on-premises platform that helps protect your enterprise from multiple types of advanced targeted cyber attacks and insider threats by using information from multiple data-sources in your network to learn the behavior of users and other entities in the organization and build a behavioral profile about them and by leveraging ATA's proprietary network parsing engine to capture and parse network traffic of multiple protocols.
