# Working with the ATA Console
This section describes the ATA Console.

## Enabling access to the ATA Console
Any user who is a member of the local Administrators group on the ATA Center server has permission to log in to the ATA Console and manage ATA settings.
To allow a user to log in to the ATA Console without making them a local administrator, add them to the local group: **Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics Administrators**.

## Logging into the ATA Console

-   In the ATA Center server, click the **Microsoft ATA Console**  icon on the desktop or open a browser and browse to the ATA Console.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, you can open a browser from either the ATA Center or the ATA Gateway and browse to the IP address you configured in the ATA Center installation for the ATA Console.    

-   Enter your username and password and click **Log in**.
